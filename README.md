## About

Computer Science student focused on designing secure, scalable information systems grounded in strong software engineering and database principles.

My interests sit at the intersection of:

- Distributed system architecture  
- Role-based access control and data isolation  
- Database design and transaction safety  
- Applied machine learning systems  

I aim to build systems that remain reliable, secure, and maintainable under real-world constraints.

## Core Project

### Distributed Hospital Information System (In Progress)

Designing a role-based digital medical records system with secure multi-tenant data access and audit traceability.

**Architecture Highlights:**
- PostgreSQL with Supabase backend  
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for query-layer data isolation  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforcement  
- Emergency access token mechanism with auditing  
- Structured audit logging for medical record access events  

**Design Focus:**
- Prevent cross-role data exposure  
- Enforce least-privilege access  
- Maintain traceability of sensitive record interactions  
- Separate authentication logic from data authorization policies
